You will work with other players to acquire resources.\\[1.25ex]

Each round, you will need to split the available resources for that round with someone.\\[1.25ex]

To do so, find a partner and agree on who will get what. Usually, this will mean one partner will get two resources while the other will get the remaining resource.\\[1.25ex]

If your partner will receive more resources than you as part of a deal, then you will receive one coin as compensation. \\[1.25ex]

Mark the tick boxes that correspond to the resources and coins that you will receive. Then, show your partner your sheet so that they can check your work.\\[1.25ex]

\textbf{Note:} You may participate in at most one partnership per round.\\[1.25ex]

The game ends at the end of the round after anyone has acquired seven coins or five of any one resource. You win if you accomplish either of the two possible game-end conditions.
